## Architecture Diagrams

This folder is intended to contain visual architecture diagrams for the Ideal Ustam backend.

- `system-architecture.png` – high-level system architecture (clients, backend services, database, email provider, etc.).
- `authentication-flow.png` – detailed authentication and password reset flow, including JWT issuance and validation.

You can generate these diagrams using tools like diagrams.net, Excalidraw, or Lucidchart and export them as PNG files with the filenames above.
